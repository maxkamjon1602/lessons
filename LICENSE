Subject to full compliance with this License, you are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:
  a. Clone and locally store the Materials;
  b. View, run, and study the Materials on your own devices; and
  c. Make minimal, transient modifications strictly necessary to run the Materials on your own devices,
solely for Personal Educational Use.

3) Prohibitions (You MAY NOT)
  a. Commercial Use: Use the Materials, or any part thereof, directly or indirectly, for commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including paid teaching/tutoring, ads, sponsorships, affiliate links, or monetized content.

  c. Public Display/Hosting: Host or make the Materials—or derivatives—publicly accessible in any form (including websites, demos, portfolios, videos, streams, or social media).

9) Governing Law & Venue
This License is governed by the laws of England and Wales, and disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of England and Wales.
