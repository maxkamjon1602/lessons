# ðŸŽ¥ Lesson 08 â€” Cameras & Projection (7 Steps, Standalone)

Each step is a **single HTML file** (no npm). All files share the same **scene scaffold** so learners stay oriented; each step adds exactly one new camera concept. Every file shows a **floating overlay** with the current step number.

## ðŸ§­ Common Controls
- Drag = orbit &nbsp;Â·&nbsp; **Shift+Drag** = pan &nbsp;Â·&nbsp; Wheel = dolly
- All steps run by double-clicking the `.html` file in your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).

---

## ðŸ—‚ Steps Overview
1. **Perspective vs Orthographic** â€” swap cameras with **1/2** and see how scale/foreshortening changes.
2. **FOV & Aspect** â€” use **[** / **]** to change FOV; resize the window to see aspect impact.
3. **Zoom vs Dolly** â€” **Z/X** changes FOV; **W/S** moves the camera in/out; HUD shows FOV vs Distance.
4. **Fit to Object** â€” key **1/2/3/0** frames Sphere/Cube/Pyramid/All using a robust `fitCameraToObject` utility.
5. **Screen â†” World** â€” click the ground to drop 3D markers via `Raycaster` (screen â†’ NDC â†’ ray â†’ intersection).
6. **Simulated Depth of Field** â€” **â†‘/â†“** adjusts focus distance; objects away from focus gently fade.
7. **Cinematic Camera Path** â€” press **Space** to play/pause a flyâ€‘through; **R** to restart; subtle FOV ease.

## ðŸ’ª Challenges
- Add controls to modify the camera's near and far clipping planes at runtime.
- Save and recall favorite camera positions with number keys.
- Toggle a `CameraHelper` to visualize the active camera's frustum.

## ðŸ§± Shared Scaffold (all steps)
- **Renderer:** antialiased WebGL, capped pixel ratio for perf, sRGB output + ACES tone mapping.
- **Scene:** ground plane (20Ã—20), subtle grid, sphere/cube/pyramid with PBR materials.
- **Lights:** Ambient (0.35) + Directional (1.0, at 6,10,6).
- **Camera:** Perspective (FOV 50Â°, near 0.1, far 300).
- **Controls:** minimal orbit/pan/dolly implemented with pointer events and wheel.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Utilities
- `fitCameraToObject(camera, object, frame=1.6)` â€” computes bounding box and sets pan & distance for a tight frame.
- `raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera)` â€” converts a click to a 3D picking ray.
- `smoothstep` & `easeInOutCubic` â€” smooth, cinematic camera motion (Step 7).

---

## ðŸ§© Troubleshooting
- **Black screen?** Check browser console for errors; ensure you have internet access to load Three.js from unpkg.
- **Very slow on highâ€‘DPI displays?** Lower pixel ratio by changing `Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2)` to `1.25`.
- **Mouse pan not working?** Hold **Shift** while dragging (or rightâ€‘click drag where supported).

## âœ… Learning Goals
By the end of Lesson 08, learners can:
- Choose **Perspective vs Orthographic** for the task at hand.
- Control **FOV, aspect, near/far** and understand clipping/precision tradeoffs.
- Explain **zoom vs dolly** and why they feel different.
- **Frame** any object or the whole scene from code.
- Convert between **screen** and **world** coordinates for picking/UI.
- Author **cinematic moves** with simple easing.
