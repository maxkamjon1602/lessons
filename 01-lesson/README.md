# Lesson 01 â€” From Blank Canvas to Interactive Shapes ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

This lesson introduces **Three.js** step by step, building from a blank canvas to interactive, animated 2D shapes.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Learn the **core workflow** of Three.js: renderer â†’ camera â†’ scene â†’ mesh.  
- Use an **orthographic camera** for pixel-based coordinates.  
- Create simple **2D shapes**: square (PlaneGeometry) and triangle (ShapeGeometry).  
- Connect **DOM controls** (checkboxes + buttons) to Three.js objects.  
- Animate objects with **rotation on Z and Y axes**.  
- Practice **incremental builds**: rerun and see each feature in isolation.

## ðŸ—‚ Step Breakdown

### [Step 01 â€” Renderer](./01-01-renderer.html)
- Create a WebGL renderer linked to `<canvas>`.
- Match device pixel ratio for crisp rendering.
- Clear screen with a dark background color.
- Start animation loop with `requestAnimationFrame`.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Renderer = paintbrush. Right now it only clears the screen.

---

### [Step 02 â€” Orthographic Camera](./01-02-ortho-camera.html)
- Add a scene container.
- Create an **OrthographicCamera** that maps `(0,0)` top-left to `(w,h)` bottom-right.
- Rebuild camera on resize for consistent pixel mapping.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Orthographic = no perspective distortion, perfect for 2D-like placement.

---

### [Step 03 â€” Square](./01-03-square.html)
- Create a white square using `PlaneGeometry`.
- Offset position so `(x,y)` feels like the **top-left corner**.
- Use `DoubleSide` to avoid disappearing on rotation.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Geometry is centered, so we adjust placement.

---

### [Step 04 â€” Triangle](./01-04-triangle.html)
- Define a custom path with `Shape` â†’ `lineTo` â†’ `closePath`.
- Convert with `ShapeGeometry`.
- Place using top-left corner of bounding box.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Any 2D polygon can be drawn as a path and used as geometry.

---

### [Step 05 â€” Toggles](./01-05-toggles.html)
- Add checkboxes in HTML.
- Link checkbox state â†’ `mesh.visible`.
- Initialize with both visible.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Connect simple DOM elements directly to scene objects.

---

### [Step 06 â€” Rotate Z](./01-06-rotate-z.html)
- Add a button for **Z-axis spin**.
- Toggle `rotatingZ` flag on click.
- In loop: `mesh.rotation.z += 0.01`.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Frame loop updates enable smooth animation. Z spin = rotate in screen plane.

---

### [Step 07 â€” Rotate Y](./01-07-rotate-y.html)
- Add a button for **Y-axis rotation**.
- Toggle `rotatingY` flag on click.
- In loop: `mesh.rotation.y += 0.01`.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key idea:** Even with orthographic camera, 3D transforms like depth rotation still work.

---

## ðŸ’ª Challenges
- Add a `CircleGeometry` as a third shape and hook it into the visibility toggles.
- Create a slider that controls the rotation speed for the Z/Y spin buttons.
- Introduce a keyboard shortcut to reset all rotations to zero.
