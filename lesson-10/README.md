# üéÆ Lesson 10 ‚Äî Side-View Camera Rig for 2.5D (Three.js)

## üöÄ What you‚Äôll build
- A **side-view camera rig** that keeps gameplay framed with an orthographic camera while allowing quick perspective comparisons.
- **Dead-zone following** so the player can move freely inside a buffer box before the camera reacts.
- **Layered parallax and tiling** for background/foreground strips that loop seamlessly as the world scrolls.

## üì¶ Files (Step 1 ‚Üí 7)
1. [Step 01 ‚Äî Ortho Side-View Base](./10-01-ortho-side-view.html): Establishes the orthographic camera, manual pan/zoom, and `P` to toggle perspective for comparison.
2. [Step 02 ‚Äî Pixel Scale & Safe-Area](./10-02-pixel-scale-and-safe-area.html): Locks world units to **PIXELS_PER_UNIT**, recomputes the frustum on resize, and overlays a safe-area frame.
3. [Step 03 ‚Äî Parallax Layers](./10-03-parallax-layers.html): Splits the scene into BG/Mid/FG groups, applies shared `applyParallax()`, debug bars (`H`), auto-pan (`Space`), and quick preset keys `1‚Äì4`.
4. [Step 04 ‚Äî Tiling Background](./10-04-tiling-background.html): Builds reusable tile prefabs for BG/FG, repositions them based on camera width, and exposes tile-bound overlays (`T`).
5. [Step 05 ‚Äî Follow Camera + Dead-Zone](./10-05-follow-camera-deadzone.html): Adds player motion, critically damped spring follow, and live dead-zone resizing with `[ ]` (width) and `;`/`'` (height).
6. [Step 06 ‚Äî Bounds & Clamp](./10-06-bounds-and-clamp.html): Defines world extents, clamps the desired camera center (with auto-center when view ‚â• world), and provides clamp/world-size toggles.
7. [Step 07 ‚Äî Presets & Polish](./10-07-presets-and-polish.html): Finalizes filmic vs pixel-art presentation (`V`), DPR handling, optional letterbox mask (`O`), and consolidated parallax resets (`R`).

## üß† New concepts
- **Dead-zone logic:** Only chase the player when they exit a configurable box, reducing micro jitter.
- **Critically damped spring:** Uses velocity feedback (`k` and `2‚àök`) for responsive easing that avoids overshoot.
- **Parallax factors:** Layer offsets use `cam * (1 ‚àí factor)` so BG (<1) lags, mid (=1) matches, and FG (>1) races ahead.
- **Horizontal tiling:** Prefab strips reposition relative to the view width to create endless scrolling scenery.
- **World clamping:** Clamp the desired camera center to `{min,max}` bounds and fall back to centering if the view is larger than the play space.

## üéπ Controls
- **Camera + scale:** Drag to pan ¬∑ Wheel or **K/L** to adjust PIXELS_PER_UNIT ¬∑ **P** toggles Ortho/Persp ¬∑ **Space** runs the auto demo (pan in Steps 3‚Äì4, run in Steps 5‚Äì7).
- **Parallax & overlays:** **1‚Äì4** preset parallax factors ¬∑ **H** shows debug parallax bars ¬∑ **T** toggles tile bounds.
- **Player & dead-zone:** **A/D** or **‚Üê/‚Üí** move horizontally ¬∑ **W/S** or **‚Üë/‚Üì** test vertical motion ¬∑ **[ ]** widen/narrow the dead-zone ¬∑ **;**/**'** adjust dead-zone height.
- **World bounds:** **M** toggles clamp logic ¬∑ **B** shows world rectangle ¬∑ **- / =** change world width ¬∑ **, / .** change world height.
- **Visual polish (Step 7):** **V** switches Filmic ‚Üî Pixel-Art mode ¬∑ **O** toggles the letterbox mask ¬∑ **R** resets visual presets.

## üß≠ Visual references
### Dead-zone follow window
![Dead-Zone](diagram_deadzone.png)
*The outer rectangle is the camera view in world units. The dashed inner box is the dead-zone (40%√ó30%). The camera only moves when the player exits this box; the `+` marks the camera center.*

### World bounds clamp
![World Clamp](diagram_bounds_clamp.png)
*The green rectangle is the world bounds. The dashed view shows the desired target; the solid view shows the clamped result so the camera never reveals space outside the level.*

### Parallax layer offsets
![Parallax](diagram_parallax.png)
*For a given `camX`, each layer gets an offset `camX*(1‚àíf)`. Background (f‚âà0.25) moves least, foreground (f>1) moves most, mid/gameplay (f=1) tracks the camera exactly.*

### Critically damped follow response
![Critically Damped Follow](chart_spring_follow.png)
*The camera (solid) eases toward the target (dashed) using a critically damped spring (k=60, c=2‚àök): quick response, minimal overshoot, stable at rest.*

## üßæ Guidance
### Performance tips
- Keep **PIXELS_PER_UNIT** between roughly 32‚Äì128 for most scenes; higher values amplify per-frame tile updates and can reveal seams if textures lack padding.
- Reuse the shared `applyParallax()` for tiles, debug bars, and layers so each frame computes offsets once.
- Disable helpers (**H**, **T**, **B**) when profiling‚Äîeach adds dozens of meshes or lines that increase overdraw.
- In Pixel-Art mode, lock DPR to 1 via `V` before recording footage to avoid inconsistent sampling.

### Troubleshooting
- Camera drifting outside the level usually means clamp is off‚Äîhit **M** and confirm world width/height exceed the current view; if the view is larger, the rig intentionally recenters.
- If PPU changes stretch sprites, ensure every `setPPU()` call recomputes the orthographic frustum before rendering.
- Seeing gaps in tiled strips? Verify tile widths match the reposition math and that `showTileBounds` (`T`) is off when judging seams.
- Parallax layers marching in sync indicates factors reverted to 1‚Äîtap **2** (Filmic preset) or reapply your custom factors and confirm `applyParallax()` runs after camera updates.

Happy rendering!
