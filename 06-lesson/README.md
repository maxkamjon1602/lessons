# üé® Lesson 06 ‚Äî Materials, Textures & Lighting in Three.js

Welcome to **Lesson 06** of the 21‚Äëpart WebGL / Three.js learning series!
This lesson focuses on **materials**, **textures**, and **lighting** to make your 3D objects come alive.

## ‚ú® What you‚Äôll build
- A **material showcase** that isolates the core PBR sliders ‚Äî color, metalness, roughness, and clearcoat ‚Äî so you can compare shading models side by side.
- **Texture-driven studies** that synthesize wood grain, checker/bump pairs, and alpha masks directly in Canvas2D before sending them into three.js.
- A **final polished scene** that places the wood plane, checker cube, glass triangle, and reflective gold pyramid under multi-lighting with orbit controls and camera toggles.

---

## üß† New concepts
- **Material properties**: compare `MeshBasicMaterial`, `MeshStandardMaterial`, and `MeshPhysicalMaterial`, and tune metalness, roughness, clearcoat, and transmission for believable responses.
- **Texture workflows**: generate procedural wood, checkerboards, bump maps, and alpha masks to drive color, depth cues, and transparency in one pass.
- **Environment mapping**: build a custom cube map, feed it through `PMREMGenerator`, and use it as both scene background and reflection source for polished renders.

---

## üì¶ Files (Step 1 ‚Üí 7)
- [Step 01 ‚Äî Basic Material Types](./06-01-Basic-material-types.html): Contrast **unlit** (`MeshBasicMaterial`) versus **lit** (`MeshStandardMaterial`) shading ‚Äî no extra controls, just watch the lighting response.
- [Step 02 ‚Äî Colors, Metalness & Roughness](./06-02-Colors-metalness-roughness.html): Cycle palettes with **C** and metal/rough presets with **M** to feel how PBR parameters change the sheen.
- [Step 03 ‚Äî Procedural Wood Texture](./06-03-Apply-image-texture-wood-canvas.html): Spin a plane coated in Canvas2D-generated wood grain; tweak the code to adjust anisotropy or repeat.
- [Step 04 ‚Äî Checkerboard + Bump Map](./06-04-Color-plus-bump-map-cube.html): Inspect how a paired color map + bump map fakes relief ‚Äî rotate automatically for grazing-angle highlights.
- [Step 05 ‚Äî Transparency + Alpha Mask](./06-05-Transparency-and-alpha-map-triangle.html): Observe glass transmission, thickness, and `alphaMap` falloff on a spinning triangle.
- [Step 06 ‚Äî Environment Map Reflections](./06-06-Environment-map-reflections.html): Build a procedural cube map, run it through `PMREMGenerator`, and study reflection intensity.
- [Step 07 ‚Äî Final Polished Scene](./06-07-Final-polish-combined-scene.html): Orbit the combined scene and switch cameras (**1** = Perspective, **2** = Ortho) while each hero asset animates slowly.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Open the folder `lesson-06/`
2. Double‚Äëclick any step (`.html` file)
3. Enjoy interactive WebGL scenes directly in your browser

*(Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge ‚Äî works offline!)*

## üí™ Challenges
- Replace the procedural wood texture with a photo texture of your choice.
- Animate metalness or roughness values over time to show material changes.
- Load an HDR environment map instead of the procedural cube map.

---

## üéÆ Controls (common across steps)
- **Mouse drag / wheel** ‚Üí orbit + dolly in the Step 07 scene (auto-rotation carries the rest).
- **C** ‚Üí cycle material colors (Step 02).
- **M** ‚Üí cycle metalness / roughness presets (Step 02).
- **1 / 2** ‚Üí Perspective ‚Üî Orthographic cameras (Step 07).
- **Click the canvas first** if hotkeys do not respond ‚Äî browser focus is required.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance tips
- Clamp `renderer.setPixelRatio()` to **~1.5‚Äì2.0** (see Step 07 helper) to avoid oversampling on 4K/Retina displays.
- The procedural **environment map** requires PMREM prefiltering; reuse a single generator/texture instead of rebuilding per frame.
- Lower texture resolutions (e.g., 256¬≤ wood/alpha maps) when targeting low-powered GPUs ‚Äî procedural generators make this trivial.
- Disable `antialias` on the renderer and rely on post-process AA if you integrate these steps into a heavier pipeline later.

---

## üß© Troubleshooting
- **Scene looks flat?** Ensure `scene.environment` is set to the PMREM texture ‚Äî background alone will not drive reflections.
- **Glass stays opaque?** Confirm `transparent: true`, `depthWrite: false`, and that your `alphaMap` has white/black contrast (Step 05 sample shows the pattern).
- **Orbit controls stutter?** Reduce the Step 07 DPR clamp or temporarily disable environment map generation to benchmark baseline performance.
- **Hotkeys ignored?** Click back into the canvas or tab, then press the shortcut again; browsers block key events when the page loses focus.
