# Lesson 2 — Grouping Shapes

This lesson builds on Lesson 1 and introduces **THREE.Group** for hierarchical transforms.

## Steps
1. **Renderer + Ortho Camera** — refresher with blank scene.
2. **Shapes Refresh** — draw square and triangle.
3. **Create Group** — make a group and add shapes as children.
4. **Move Group** — move the entire group with one transform.
5. **Rotate Group** — toggle rotation for the whole group.
6. **Group + Individual Animations** — group spins while items rotate independently.
7. **Toggles: Group vs Items** — buttons to control group vs item rotations separately.

## Run
Serve the folder with any static server and open each step by path, e.g.:

```
python -m http.server 5173
# http://localhost:5173/lesson-02-increments/01-renderer/
# http://localhost:5173/lesson-02-increments/02-shapes/
# ...
```
