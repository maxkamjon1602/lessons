# üéØ Lesson 02 ‚Äî Grouping Shapes

Welcome! This lesson levels up your Lesson 01 primitives into a **hierarchical scene** where multiple meshes share transforms through a parent `THREE.Group`.

## ‚ú® What you‚Äôll build
- Compose a square and triangle into a **single group** so they translate together.
- Layer **shared + individual rotations** to see how local vs world space interact.
- Add lightweight UI toggles that let you compare **group motion** against **per-mesh motion** live.

## üì¶ Files (Step 1 ‚Üí 7)
- [Step 01 ‚Äî Renderer + Ortho Camera](./02-01-renderer.html): Rebuilds the renderer/camera baseline with an orthographic view sized to the canvas.
- [Step 02 ‚Äî Shapes Refresh](./02-02-shapes.html): Draws the square + triangle meshes and positions them in screen space.
- [Step 03 ‚Äî Create Group](./02-03-group-create.html): Wraps both meshes in a `THREE.Group` and adds it to the scene graph.
- [Step 04 ‚Äî Move Group](./02-04-group-move.html): Demonstrates translating the parent group to move every child together.
- [Step 05 ‚Äî Rotate Group](./02-05-group-rotate.html): Introduces a button that toggles a shared spin for the entire group.
- [Step 06 ‚Äî Group + Individual Animations](./02-06-group-and-individual.html): Keeps the group spin toggle and layers counter-rotations on each child mesh.
- [Step 07 ‚Äî Toggles: Group vs Items](./02-07-toggles.html): Adds dual buttons so you can enable/disable parent vs child rotations independently.

## üß† New concepts
- **Scene graph grouping**: `THREE.Group` lets you collect meshes so you can move, rotate, or scale them with one parent transform.
- **Shared transforms**: Applying rotation/position on the group updates every child in its local space‚Äîgreat for rigid assemblies.
- **Simultaneous animations**: Parent and child animations combine, illustrating how local rotations accumulate on top of group motion.

## üéπ Controls (progressive)
- **UI buttons (Steps 5‚Äì7)**: Click **Rotate Group** to toggle the parent‚Äôs spin. In Step 7, use **Rotate Items** to pause/resume each mesh‚Äôs individual motion.
- **Window resize**: The orthographic camera recalculates on resize so the group stays centered without extra input.
- **Focus tip**: Buttons grab focus after you click them‚Äîpress `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` to move focus away if you plan to test keyboard interactions.

## üß© Troubleshooting
- **Group won‚Äôt rotate**: Confirm the animation loop updates `group.rotation.z` and that the toggle state flips the boolean controlling it.
- **Only one mesh moves**: Make sure both meshes are added via `group.add(...)`; applying transforms directly to a mesh bypasses the shared parent.
- **Buttons feel unresponsive**: Check that the `<button>` elements sit inside the `#controls` overlay and aren‚Äôt covered by the canvas (z-order).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & usage tips
- Keep animations smooth by updating **group transforms once per frame** and reusing meshes; avoid recreating geometry in the loop.
- When testing toggles, let the button retain focus so pressing **Space/Enter** quickly re-triggers the click handler‚Äîhandy for comparisons.
- Re-centering the group? Adjust the group‚Äôs `position` instead of each child so offsets remain consistent across steps.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for your Lesson 01 ‚Üí 02 grouping journey.
Happy grouping!
