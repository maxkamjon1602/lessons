# Lesson 2 — Grouping Shapes

This lesson builds on Lesson 1 and introduces **THREE.Group** for hierarchical transforms.

## Steps
1. **Renderer + Ortho Camera** — refresher with blank scene.
2. **Shapes Refresh** — draw square and triangle.
3. **Create Group** — make a group and add shapes as children.
4. **Move Group** — move the entire group with one transform.
5. **Rotate Group** — toggle rotation for the whole group.
6. **Group + Individual Animations** — group spins while items rotate independently.
7. **Toggles: Group vs Items** — buttons to control group vs item rotations separately.

## Challenges
- Add a new shape (e.g., a circle) to the group and include it in the rotation logic.
- Create a second group with its own position and rotation controls.
- Add UI to scale individual shapes within the group.

## Run
All html files can be run with normal browsers.
