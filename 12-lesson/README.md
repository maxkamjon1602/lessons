# Lesson 12 ‚Äî Combat, Hazards & Responsive Camera (Steps 1‚Äì7)

> **From traversal to combat:** this lesson upgrades our 2.5D platformer with  
> ‚öîÔ∏è *attack chaining*, ‚ò†Ô∏è *hazards*, üé• *cinematic camera rig*, and ‚ú® *polish systems*.  

---

## TL;DR

- **Combat System:** 3-hit combo chain, facing-based hitboxes, cooldown windows.  
- **Hazards:** Solid spike pits that kill on touch ‚Äî no jump-through exploits.  
- **Camera:** OrbitControls rig with fixed radius, azimuth/polar constraints, smooth reset.  
- **Checkpoints:** Glowing spheres, emissive feedback, respawn with invulnerability.  
- **FX Polish:** Dust bursts, screen flash, camera shake.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or copy the **seven HTML files** (`step-01.html` ‚Ä¶ `step-07.html`) into a folder.  
2. Run a local server:  
   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   # or: python -m http.server 8000
   ```  
3. Open `step-07.html` in a modern browser.  
4. Controls:  
   - **W / ‚Üë / Space** ‚Äî Jump  
   - **A / D** ‚Äî Walk / Air control  
   - **J / Left-Click** ‚Äî Attack (combo chain)  
   - **Arrow Keys** ‚Äî Adjust camera orbit

## Keyboard & Mouse Reference

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **A / D** | Move left / right |
| **W / ‚Üë / Space** | Jump |
| **J** | Attack (same as left mouse click) |
| **Arrow Keys** | Adjust orbit camera (azimuth/pitch) |
| **Mouse Drag** | Rotate camera (OrbitControls) |
| **Checkpoints** | Auto-save respawn point |
| **Hazards** | Instant respawn with flash + shake |

## Key Systems

### 1. Combat (3-Hit Combo)

- **Facing-based hitbox:** Always spawns in front of player along X.  
- **Combo window:** Each attack must be timed during cooldown to chain.  
- **Hitbox Debug Mesh:** Red transparent box (toggle in code).  

![Combo Chain](./assets-readme/chart_combo_timing.png)

### 2. Hazards

- Solid, no jump-through.  
- Kill player instantly when capsule touches spike mesh AABB.  
- On death:  
  - White **screen flash**  
  - Camera **shake**  
  - Respawn at last checkpoint  

![Hazard Pit](./assets-readme/diagram_hazard.png)

### 3. Camera Rig

- Fixed radius (10).  
- Constrained azimuth (¬±45¬∞) and pitch (‚àí75¬∞ to +15¬∞).  
- Smooth reset to default angles when idle.  
- Drag and arrow-key nudges both supported.  

![Camera Rig](./assets-readme/diagram_camera.png)

### 4. Checkpoints

- Sphere with emissive glow.  
- On contact:  
  - Saves respawn point  
  - Visual feedback (color shift, scaling pulse)  
  - Respawn returns here with brief invulnerability
