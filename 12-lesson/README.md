# Lesson 12 ‚Äî Combat, Hazards & Responsive Camera (Steps 1‚Äì7)

> **From traversal to combat:** this lesson upgrades our 2.5D platformer with  
> ‚öîÔ∏è *attack chaining*, ‚ò†Ô∏è *hazards*, üé• *cinematic camera rig*, and ‚ú® *polish systems*.  

---

## TL;DR

- **Combat System:** 3-hit combo chain, facing-based hitboxes, cooldown windows.  
- **Hazards:** Solid spike pits that kill on touch ‚Äî no jump-through exploits.  
- **Camera:** OrbitControls rig with fixed radius, azimuth/polar constraints, smooth reset.  
- **Checkpoints:** Glowing spheres, emissive feedback, respawn with invulnerability.  
- **FX Polish:** Dust bursts, screen flash, camera shake.  

## üñº Demo Overview

![Checkpoint](assets-readme/checkpoint.png)  
*A glowing checkpoint that saves respawn position.*

![Hazard](assets-readme/hazard.png)  
*Spikes that respawn the player upon touch.*

![Combo](assets-readme/combo.png)  
*3-hit attack combo chain demonstration.*

## Quick Start

1. Clone or copy the **seven HTML files** (`step-01.html` ‚Ä¶ `step-07.html`) into a folder.  
2. Run a local server:  
   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   # or: python -m http.server 8000
   ```  
3. Open `step-07.html` in a modern browser.  
4. Controls:  
   - **W / ‚Üë / Space** ‚Äî Jump  
   - **A / D** ‚Äî Walk / Air control  
   - **J / Left-Click** ‚Äî Attack (combo chain)  
   - **Arrow Keys** ‚Äî Adjust camera orbit

## Keyboard & Mouse Reference

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **A / D** | Move left / right |
| **W / ‚Üë / Space** | Jump |
| **J** | Attack (same as left mouse click) |
| **Arrow Keys** | Adjust orbit camera (azimuth/pitch) |
| **Mouse Drag** | Rotate camera (OrbitControls) |
| **Checkpoints** | Auto-save respawn point |
| **Hazards** | Instant respawn with flash + shake |

## Project Structure (Steps 1‚Äì7)

```
step-01.html   Base combat input
step-02.html   Attack hitbox + facing
step-03.html   Combo chain (3 hits)
step-04.html   Hazards (spike pits) kill on touch
step-05.html   Respawn + checkpoints
step-06.html   Camera rig with constraints
step-07.html   Polish: dust, flash
```

## üîë Key Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Checkpoints** | Save respawn points when touched; glow & scale effect shows activation. |
| **Hazards** | Spike pits with invisible collider boxes ‚Äì touching them resets hero to last checkpoint. |
| **3-Hit Combo** | Attack chaining system with short cooldowns (0.35s), supports spamming with animation FX. |
| **Camera Tracking** | Always glued to hero with arrow key + mouse drag support, reset when idle. |
| **Platform Collisions** | Ground platforms block from above only (no jump-through for global ground). |
| **Dust FX** | Visual feedback when landing or attacking. |
| **Coyote Time** | Short grace period (0.12s) after leaving a platform still allows a jump. |

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Platforms** ‚Äì created using `makeBlock()`.  
2. **Checkpoints** ‚Äì glowing spheres; touching them sets respawn.  
3. **Hazards** ‚Äì spike pits built with cones + invisible collider.  
4. **Camera** ‚Äì follows hero, arrow keys/mouse drag to rotate.  
5. **Combat** ‚Äì left-click or `J` key triggers attacks.  
6. **3-Hit Combo** ‚Äì chaining attack states into a sequence.  
7. **Final Polish** ‚Äì dust FX, respawn flash, screen shake.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Hero falls through ground | Collider logic not applied to global ground | Ensure `makeBlock` ground uses width ‚â• 30 and `box.setFromObject()` called each frame |
| Camera doesn‚Äôt follow hero | `updateCamera(dt)` not running | Verify `onTick()` calls `updateCamera(dt)` |
| Attack doesn‚Äôt trigger while moving | Pointer event swallowed by controls | Use capture-phase listeners or fallback key (`J`) |
| Hazards don‚Äôt kill hero | `group.userData.box` missing | Check `makeSpikePit` sets `userData.box` properly |
| Checkpoint not saving | Distance threshold too small | Increase allowed `dx, dy` ranges (e.g. 0.6, 0.7) |

## Challenges

- Extend combo to 4 hits with finisher animation.  
- Moving hazard variants.  
- Give checkpoints a **sound effect** when activated.
